Gravity is one of the most easily observable force in the universe. Throw a stone upward and it comes down due to gravity. But understanding the actual cause of gravity is not that easy. In fact it's still unknown.
Newton formulated that the gravitational force is directly proportional to the product of the masses, between which gravity acts. :D

$$E=mc^2$$
